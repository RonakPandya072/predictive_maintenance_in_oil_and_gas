# Predictive Maintenance in Oil and Gas industry using Machine learning

Built an end-to-end model on streamlit framework to analyze well performance using machine learning models. The project consists of measuring well flow rates, critical flow rate, and PVT properties calculation. The objective of the work is to identify the underperforming wells and perform a workover operation to minimize the Non-Productive Time.  Dataset used to train a model is the Volvo field dataset (an open-source dataset for oil and gas). Visit the web app: https://ml-in-oil-and-gas.herokuapp.com/
