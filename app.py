In oil reservoirs, a large oil rate can cause upward coning of water or downward coning of gas into the well perforations. Once gas or water is produced, the oil rate decreases and the cost of water and/or gas handling is increased. There is a critical rate below which the cone remains stable and does not break through to the wellbore. In the present work, a simple-to-use approach, which is easier than existing approaches, less complicated with fewer calculations, is formulated to arrive at an appropriate estimation of critical oil rate for bottom water coning in anisotropic and homogeneous formations with the well completed from the top of the formation. This simple-to-use correlation can be of immense practical value for petroleum engineers to have a quick check on estimating the critical oil rate for wide range of conditions without the necessity of any field test trials. In particular, petroleum engineers would find the proposed approach to be user friendly involving transparent calculations with no complex expressions for their calculations.")

These properties can be determined in the laboratory at specified conditions of pressure and temperature. To estimate PVT fluid properties at a wider range of conditions of pressure and temperature, an empirical correlation should be used where there are no laboratory measurements. These empirical correlations can, however, only be used after making the appropriate adjustments to the specified crude oil samples. In this study, the data from laboratory measurements of the PVT properties for five oil samples were used. These five samples were collected from different wells within the Luhais oil field. The measurements were taken at reservoir conditions with slight differencesfrom one sample to another. The five samples were then adjusted to the empirical correlations and the saturation pressure determined. Theresulting models of the samples after adjustment were combined to estimate a generalised model of the fluid properties that represented the properties of the studied crude oil.")
